### Using [**pry-byebug**][pry-byebug] and not happy with commands behavior? We recommend this project instead

# pry-moves

_An execution control add-on for [Pry][pry]._


## Commands:

* `n` - **next** line in current frame, including block lines (moving to next line goes as naturally expected)
* `s` - **step** into function execution
  * `s func_name` - steps into first method called by name `func_name`
* `f` - **finish** execution of current frame and stop at next line on higher level
* `c` - **continue**
* `bt` - backtrace
* `!` - exit


## Examples

To use, invoke `pry` normally:

```ruby
def some_method
  binding.pry          # Execution will stop here.
  puts 'Hello, World!' # Run 'step' or 'next' in the console to move here.
end
```

## Technical info

`pry-moves` is not yet thread-safe, so only use in single-threaded environments.

Rudimentary support for [`pry-remote`][pry-remote] (>= 0.1.1) is also included.
Ensure `pry-remote` is loaded or required before `pry-moves`. For example, in a
`Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'pry'
gem 'pry-remote'
gem 'pry-moves'
```

Please note that debugging functionality is implemented through
[`set_trace_func`][set_trace_func], which imposes a large performance
penalty.
